# Dependencies testing

Since today (2018-04-22) let's experiment with not making
a new release every time but with publishing all the
archives into the same place.

# 2018-03-26

Build with MK stable and updated dependencies for upcoming
MK v0.8.2 relase.

- geoip v1.6.12
- libressl v2.6.4
- libevent patches-2.1 branch

# 2018-03-03

Build with new [MK build system](
https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/pull/1561)
where we're tweaking the build scripts after simplifications
that occurred in [#1554](
https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/pull/1554).

- geoip v1.6.11
- libressl v2.5.5
- libevent patches-2.1 branch
